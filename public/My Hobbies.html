<h1><i><u>My Hobbies</u></i></h1>
As an upcoming coder with a deep passion for technology, I spend much of my time exploring programming languages, building small projects, and learning how to write clean, efficient, and creative code. Outside the digital world, I’m an intermediate chef who enjoys experimenting in the kitchen—testing out new recipes, combining unexpected flavors, and understanding the science behind cooking.
 I also have an active side: I love swimming and playing badminton, both of which help me stay focused, energized, and balanced. These hobbies not only fuel my personal growth but also inspire my <b>professional ambitions.</b>
  I have ideas for combining my interests into a unique business—perhaps creating an app that blends food, fitness, and tech, like a platform for meal planning that adapts to physical activity or mood, or interactive cooking guides that respond to user preferences through smart coding.
  By integrating my love for cooking, sports, and coding, I aim to build tools that are innovative, practical, and rooted in real-life experience.
