<h1><i><u>About Me</u></i></h1>
As a Nigerian-American, I carry the strength, resilience, and ambition of two rich cultures that constantly motivate me to strive for excellence.
 My professional aspirations lie at the intersection of business and coding, where I hope to build innovative solutions that solve real-world problems and create lasting value.
  I dream of becoming not just a skilled developer, but also a forward-thinking entrepreneur who leads impactful projects and inspires others. A big part of my motivation comes from my desire to support my familyâ€”both physically and financially.
   I want to be someone they can rely on, someone who turns effort into opportunity and success into security. My background has taught me the importance of hard work, sacrifice, and vision, and these values continue to push me to break barriers and aim high.
    I see every line of code and every idea as a step closer to building a future where I can uplift not only myself, but those I love.
